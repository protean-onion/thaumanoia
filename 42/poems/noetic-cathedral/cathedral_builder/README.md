This script models the poem's argument that meaning is an emergent property of:

Struggle Processing (`struggles` list): Raw experience becomes construction material through the `find_keystones()` method, mirroring the poem's "grief-mortared bricks." Like Kierkegaard's knight of faith, we transform paradox into architecture.

Perceptual Discipline (`grind_lens()`): The Husserlian "epochÄ“" becomes an algorithm - repeated bracketing of assumptions (`epochs`) increases resolution to detect sacred patterns in data-noise.

Iterative Becoming (`construct_cathedral()` loop): The Nietzschean recurrence - rebuilding with same materials reflects life's Sisyphean repetition. Each `ARCH_PARADOX` entry embodies the poem's "yes groaned into void."

Incompleteness (`__str__` method): The output remains perpetually unfinished, containing both arches and cracks. Like Merleau-Ponty's lived body, meaning emerges through the ratio of understood arches to unseen cracks.

Sacramentalization (`baptize_mundane()`): Ordinary objects ("rust", "rain") become sacred through attention vectors, actualizing the poem's "nail in the guise of rust."

The program doesn't return a final truth (`CATHEDRAL_BUILT` is boolean fiction) but generates meaning through runtime - a computational analog to the poem's "meaning is the making." Each run produces different ratios of arches/cracks, modeling life's contingent yet patterned meaning-construction.

Like the poem's "blind mason," the script's builder works without teleological assurance, its `perceptions` counter approximating spiritual discipline. The final printout isn't an answer but a snapshot of becoming - our existential position between `ARCH` and `ABYSS`.

Cathedrals Unseen

Beneath the grid of sidewalk cracks, a nave—
each cobble’s moss a stained-glass scene. The rain
translates the air to psalm. Here, shadows carve
buttressed voids where beggars cup the arcane
light of coins. You, wanderer, kneel. Begin
the askesis: unstitch your sight. The street
is vaulted by the oaks’ ribbed limbs, their spin
of leaves a choir humming Kyrie. Repeat

the catechism of the cracked: Kierkegaard’s
knight, infinite, grips faith like a splinter;
Nietzsche’s abyss, a mirror for the starred
and splintered self. The desert’s blank winter
blooms spires when you squint—your thirst, a well.
The world’s a palimpsest. Trace where the ink
of rivers scripts I am on stone. The bell
of dusk rings through the alley’s chiseled brink.

What discipline dissolves the cataract?
A lifetime’s grit to grind the lens:
to suffer Proust’s madeleine, exact
as Euclid, or Beckett’s purgatorial dens
where waiting is the altar. You must lose
the myth of elsewhere. Here, the breadcrumb trail
of stars is swallowed by the rat’s-eyed news—
yet still, the architect insists: Unveil

the blueprint in the wound. Each grief, a brick
mortared with breath. Each doubt, the groin where curves
collide to bear the weight. The trick
is not to decode symbols, but carve
and be carved. Lift your chisel. Every yes
groaned into void becomes a keystone. Rise,
blind mason. Your hands, raw with paradox,
will find the arch in ache, the spire in sighs.

So build. Not toward some celestial there—
but deeper into mud, where roots cathedralize.
The meaning is the making. Everywhere,
the unseen waits, a nail in the guise
of rust, of rain, of breath. To hammer now
into a truss, a raft, a sacred ground.
The blueprint’s written as you bow
and strain: the nave’s not found. It must be drowned

in sight. The meaning is the making. Lift
the ordinary into anthem. Let your palms
callus with awe. The world’s a gift
unwrapped by breaking—every fracture, psalms.

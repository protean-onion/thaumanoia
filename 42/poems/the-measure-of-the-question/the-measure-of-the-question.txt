The Measure of the Question

In the husk of the cosmos, where silence takes root,  
the Question unfurls—a primordial flute.  
Not the answer, which binds like a chain to a stone,  
but the breath of the unknown, in marrow and bone.  

It is compass, not north; it is scale without weight,  
the lens that dissolves what we calcify as “state.”  
A ruler that measures the gaps between stars,  
the space where the infinite bleeds through its scars.  

All measures collapse when the Question arrives—  
the dip of a wing as the swallow contrives  
to map the wind’s whim. What is depth but a guess?  
The ocean’s abyss? Just a thimble’s caress.  

The clock counts its ticks, but the *Why* splits the hour,  
unspools the taut thread of dominion and power.  
The *How* carves a door where the wall stood austere;  
the *What If* ignites galaxies year after year.  

No yardstick can hold it, no ledger contain  
the currency traded in wonder’s bright vein.  
For the answer’s a cage, but the question’s a key  
to the vault where the void hums *Possibility*.  

So let scales tip and shatter, let clocks lose their gears—  
the true measure walks in the asking, not years.  
A fathomless unit, both anchor and wave,  
the Question is all that the boundless will crave.  

It weighs without weight, it defines by release,  
the echo that turns every ending to peace.  
The ultimate measure? Not gold, nor degrees—  
but the pulse of the *Why* that outlives galaxies.

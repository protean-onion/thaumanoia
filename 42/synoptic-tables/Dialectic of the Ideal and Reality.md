| # | Name of the Moment | Phenomenological Texture | Mind's Relation to the Transcendental Idea | Dominant Affective Tone | Typical Cognitive / Moral Pitfall | Lever for Transition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Naïve Positing | The Ideal shines as a self-evident horizon; reality is barely noticed | Idea is taken as given fact (confusion of regulative with constitutive use—subreption) | Wonder, attraction | Uncritical projection; "of course things are (or will be) like this" | First empirical frustration |
| 2 | Empirical Encounter | Concrete facts clash with the image; the crack appears | Idea remains unexamined; facts judged "aberrant" | Surprise, irritation | Denial of evidence; scapegoating | Repeated inconsistency forces reflection |
| 3 | Defensive Denial | Active refusal to integrate the gap ("It mustn't be!") | Idea absolutised; reality delegitimised | Anguish, rage, magical thinking | Splitting, blame, idealised nostalgia | Safe dialogical space or inward honesty that allows mourning |
| 4 | Reflective Mourning | Sorrowful recognition of finitude; suspension between worlds | Idea recovered as regulative (guiding, not guaranteed) | Grief, humility | Cynical collapse ("Nothing matters") | Rediscovery of respect for freedom—one's own & others' |
| 5 | Critical Reconciliation | Ability to hold Ideal and fact together without fusion | Idea now consciously adopted as self-legislated maxim | Calm seriousness (Achtung) | Paralysis by analysis; endless critique | Small deliberate acts that embody the maxim |
| 6 | Transformative Praxis | Energetic engagement: reshaping the situation in light of the Ideal | Idea becomes motor of action; feedback loop with reality | Hopeful resolve | Activist overreach; impatience | Communal practices that sustain effort & correct excess |
| 7 | Generative Teaching | One becomes a living witness; helps others face the same paradox | Idea functions as shared horizon—both held and handed on | Joy tinged with gravity | Complacency ("mission accomplished") | Continuous self-critique; openness to the next Ideal |

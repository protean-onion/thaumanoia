| **Failure Mode**                                           | **Description / Phenomenology**                                                         | **Empirical Examples / Observations**                                                                                                                 | **Ontological Consequence**                                                                                                              |

| **Desire Collapse: Avoidance of Tension**                  | Subject refuses to dwell in the gap, seeking closure where none is possible.            | Obsessive need for certainty; excessive control behaviors; over-reliance on rules or routines; intolerance of ambiguity.                              | Truth remains closed; subject becomes inert, flattened, closed to the world’s unconcealment.                                             |
| **Desire Substitution: Fixation on Ersatz Objects**        | Tension is displaced onto substitute objects, partial or illusory satisfactions.        | Addictive behaviors (substances, media, workaholism); fetishization of possessions or relationships; compulsive goal-chasing.                         | Partial givenness is grasped as totality; movement toward the noumenal horizon is arrested; subject mistakes representation for reality. |
| **Desire Dissociation: Fragmented Self**                   | Subject experiences internal splitting, inability to integrate longing with experience. | Dissociative episodes; chronic ambivalence; emotional numbing; avoidance of introspection.                                                            | The ontological measure fractures; the subject fails to hold the tension; unconcealment cannot emerge coherently.                        |
| **Desire Deflection: Externalization of Otherness**        | Tension is projected outward, treating internal lack as external fault.                 | Blaming others for dissatisfaction; externalizing anxiety; hyper-critical or persecutory social dynamics.                                             | Otherness is denied as internal; the subject avoids receptivity to the extimate; truth appears as alien or hostile.                      |
| **Desire Paralysis: Overwhelm by Impossibility**           | Awareness of totality’s impossibility triggers stasis, inability to act.                | Existential anxiety, indecision, analysis paralysis; depressive immobilization.                                                                       | The world cannot be disclosed; finitude becomes catastrophic rather than generative; subject ceases to move toward Truth.                |
| **Desire Commodification: Instrumentalization of Tension** | Desire is treated purely as a means to control outcomes.                                | Over-strategizing learning, relationships, or creativity; “goal-oriented” living devoid of lived depth; gaming systems rather than experiencing them. | Truth collapses into mastery; the tension is neutralized instrumentally; unconcealment becomes inaccessible.                             |

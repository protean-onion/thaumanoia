|       1 | Mechanical Decoder         | Isolated words; letter-by-letter parsing                 | Collapsed; each word appears in isolation                                 | Literal decoding only; no synthesis beyond the sentence                                                           | Tense, effortful, fatigued                   | Experience not yet unified; subject remains outside text                               |
|       2 | Linear Follower            | Word-by-word grasp; builds across clauses                | Short protention; partial retention                                       | Sequential comprehension; tracks basic narrative or argument                                                      | Slight flow; success is fragile              | Begins synthesis of parts; world begins to cohere                                      |
|       3 | Coherent Synthesizer       | Integrates sentence-level meanings                       | Holds longer arcs of protention and retention                             | Meaning builds across paragraphs and chapters; thematic resonance emerges                                         | Pleasure in understanding; feeling of flow   | A world begins to appear; reader steps into it                                         |
|       4 | Affective Resonator        | Recognizes symbolic, emotional, and tonal resonance      | Anticipates shifts in tone, rhythm, mood                                  | Not just what it says, but how it says it; begins to “feel” the text’s inner movement                             | Sensitive, moved, textured affect            | The text becomes a mood-space; self is modulated by reading                            |
|       5 | Interpretive Player        | Sees multiple layers of meaning; ambiguity is productive | Weaves shifting horizons; anticipates philosophical or poetic depth       | Engages intertextuality, metaphor, rhythm, style; reads with the text’s movement                                  | Joy of interpretive play; reverent curiosity | Reader co-shapes the world of the text; becomes a partner in sense-making              |
|       6 | Transcendental Participant | Recognition is no longer distinct from becoming          | Lives through complex temporal arcs; past/future constellate into the now | Meaning arises through the reader’s lived schematism; no longer mere comprehension, but ontological participation | Sublime stillness; rapture; surrender        | Text becomes event-of-being; self and text dissolve into co-constitution               |
|       7 | Mystic Reader              | Recognition flashes as unmediated presence               | Temporality becomes ecstatic: now as fullness, not sequence               | Meaning cannot be paraphrased; it is intuited, lived, ineffable                                                   | Stillness, awe, communion                    | Reading is no longer reading—it is dwelling in the appearing of Being through language |

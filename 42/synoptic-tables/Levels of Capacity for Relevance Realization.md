|:---------|:-------------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------|:------------------|
| 0. **Collapsed RR** | Complete paralysis; unable to feel what matters. | Numbness, panic, despair. | No salience or random intrusive flashes. | World is alien or oppressive. | Hyper-abstract theorizing or total confusion. | Gentle sensory grounding; basic acts of perception (e.g., touch, color noticing). |
| 1. **Externally-Dependent RR** | Only what others approve becomes salient. | Shame, dependency, self-erasure. | Salience controlled by external validation. | World is judge; self is passive reactor. | Mimetic learning; over-adaptation. | Controlled environments encouraging free self-expression without evaluation. |
| 2. **Fragmented RR** | Sporadic internal salience; quickly crushed or doubted. | Anxiety, excitement-crash cycles. | Bursts of meaningfulness that collapse. | World is unstable; self seeks anchors. | Episodic insight; self-undermining. | Practices that stabilize attention and self-permission (journaling, free writing, exploratory walks). |
| 3. **Fragile Self-Generated RR** | Self-generated salience emerges but feels fragile and vulnerable. | Hopefulness mixed with fear of regression. | Salience patterns form but need active protection. | World is partially livable; trust still conditional. | First intuitive thinking; tender experimentation. | Deliberate projects rooted in personal love, with low-stakes risk-taking (creative projects, study circles). |
| 4. **Stable Self-Generated RR** | Salience realization flows more steadily from within. | Deepening trust, cautious joy. | Salience shapes coherent engagements. | World becomes co-creator rather than enemy. | Integrative thinking; style begins to show. | Structured exploration and challenges; cultivation of personal style (art, philosophy, craft). |
| 5. **Harmonious RR** | Salience flows freely and flexibly in response to life. | Joy, gratitude, awe. | Dynamic adaptability: attention tunes itself to evolving needs. | World and self are co-articulated in play. | Deep insight, intuition, and logos in harmony. | Living artistic-ethical projects; sharing insight generatively with others. |
| 6. **Transcendent RR** | Salience realization becomes a way of participating in Being itself. | Sublime love, sacredness of existence. | Reality discloses itself through the self; self becomes medium of unfolding. | World is home; self is cosmic participant. | Non-dual knowing; fusion of intellect, eros, and action. | Philosophical-artistic life rooted in service to reality and beauty itself. |

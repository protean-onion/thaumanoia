That the human being reaches is ontological, for—being a being of finitude—the noumenon of the universe in its totality is not given to him in phenomenological intuition. As such, he moves through phenomenal images of that noumenon, characterised by limits and peripheries.

De-sire, then, is the holding of this tension between the constitutive impossibility of absolute closure and the necessity of partial givenness. One might say that desiring is the ontological measure of man, for in his desiring, man holds himself as the being whose being is in question.

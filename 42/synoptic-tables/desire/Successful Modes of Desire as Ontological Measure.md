| **Successful Mode**                      | **Description / Phenomenology**                                                                         | **Empirical Examples / Observations**                                                              | **Ontological Effect / Truth Disclosure**                                                                                                 |

| **Tensive Holding**                      | Subject embraces the gap between impossibility and partial givenness without rushing to closure.        | Mindful engagement with uncertainty; reflective decision-making; openness to ambiguity.            | The clearing remains open; phenomena can show themselves in richness; Truth appears as process, not possession.                           |
| **Playful Substitution**                 | Partial objects or experiences are used not to replace the horizon but as means of orienting toward it. | Artistic creation; exploratory learning; playful experimentation; symbolic engagement.             | Desire remains generative; the subject uses representation without collapsing it into totality; world unfolds as more than sum of parts.  |
| **Integrative Self-Reception**           | Subject acknowledges internal otherness and integrates it into lived experience.                        | Self-reflection, journaling, therapy, creative expression; capacity to hold conflicting emotions.  | Subject maintains coherence while remaining divided; openness to unconcealment; truth becomes personally resonant.                        |
| **Internalization of Otherness**         | Otherness is received within, rather than projected outward.                                            | Empathic imagination; contemplative practice; active listening; nuanced moral judgment.            | Extimate kernels (inner strangeness) become productive; relational openness deepens; truth appears as shared and singular simultaneously. |
| **Active Engagement with Impossibility** | Subject acts even under awareness of limits; embraces finitude as condition for movement.               | Courageous decision-making; experimentation without guarantee of success; existential exploration. | The tension energizes disclosure; finitude becomes the horizon that allows truth to manifest dynamically.                                 |
| **Non-Instrumental Attunement**          | Desire is experienced as orientation, not as control; tension is lived rather than used.                | Meditation, contemplative practice, deep dialogue, immersion in art/nature; flow states.           | The clearing is sustained; phenomena disclose themselves on their own terms; the subject participates in truth rather than possessing it. |

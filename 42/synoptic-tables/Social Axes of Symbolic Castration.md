| Axis                       | How Symbolic Castration Differs                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Class**                  | Upper classes often internalize the law as symbolic mastery; lower classes may be symbolically overexposed (shame) or under-inscribed (excluded from the scene of law)      |
| **Race**                   | Racialized subjects may be positioned as **pre-symbolic**, denied full subjecthood; symbolic law operates via misrecognition or hyper-visibility                            |
| **Gender**                 | The Symbolic functions asymmetrically for masculine and feminine subjects; the **feminine** may occupy a **"not-all"** relation to castration                               |
| **Culture**                | In non-Western traditions, initiation into the Symbolic may be organized through different figures (ancestor, cosmic law, etc.), or operate through shame rather than guilt |
| **Institutional Position** | Bureaucrats, artists, soldiers, caretakersâ€”each are subjected to a different Symbolic field with its own fantasies and laws of enjoyment                                    |

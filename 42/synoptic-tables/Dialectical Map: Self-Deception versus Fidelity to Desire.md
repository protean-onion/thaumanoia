| **1. Awareness of Desire**                     | Denial or misrecognition of one’s true desire; substituting socially-approved or imagined desires for one’s own. | - *Bad faith* (Sartre): hiding behind roles, excuses, norms.<br>- *Alienation* (Lacan): mistaking the Other’s desire for one’s own.<br>- Repression or rationalization. | - Feeling hollow or unfulfilled.<br>- Anxiety that cannot be clearly identified.                                | Confront desire honestly; distinguish *own desire* from the Other’s expectations.                 | Emergent clarity; one begins to recognize patterns of misalignment and subtle self-betrayal.         |
| **2. Initial Engagement with Desire**          | Hesitation or avoidance; partial acknowledgement with internal caveats.                                          | - Intellectualization or moralization of desire.<br>- Projection onto external objects.                                                                                 | - Wasted energy pursuing the wrong goals.<br>- Inner tension and guilt.                                         | Experiment with desire in small, concrete ways; allow it to manifest without full commitment yet. | Embodied sense of what is truly compelling; first experience of desire unmediated by social scripts. |
| **3. Resistance / Fear of Consequences**       | Retreat into safety, rationality, or conformity.                                                                 | - Anticipatory anxiety about social judgment, failure, or shame.<br>- Defensive self-deception: “I don’t really want this anyway.”                                      | - Psychological stagnation.<br>- Increasing alienation from self.<br>- Partial life lived only in “appearance.” | Courageous confrontation with fear; accept risk of disappointment or failure as part of fidelity. | Expanded sense of agency; energy freed from dissimulation.                                           |
| **4. Full Acceptance / Ownership**             | Rare in self-deception; usually absent until crisis forces confrontation.                                        | - Recognition that one’s desire is irreducible and cannot be fully mediated.                                                                                            | - Crisis of identity if previously alienated.<br>- Confrontation with responsibility.                           | Step fully into the desire; articulate it, act in alignment with it, even if imperfectly.         | Deep vitality; emergent creativity; alignment of action and being.                                   |
| **5. Sustained Fidelity / Authentic Practice** | N/A in pure self-deception.                                                                                      | - Continuous self-monitoring to detect relapse into self-deception.                                                                                                     | - Minimal costs if vigilance maintained.                                                                        | Integrate desire with reflection, ethics, and relational awareness.                               | Life imbued with meaning; self-deception loses grip; resonance with one’s own trajectory emerges.    |

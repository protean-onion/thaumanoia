Vagueness is anxiety,
Depression is overwhelmed;
We need a serendipity,
That may put us at the help.

How might we generate it
When our hearts are trepid?

In our search, we need our minds held
By an Other with whom we may meld.

42 is the answer It serenely gives
To Life, the Universe, and Everything.
The Infinite Aspectuality of Objecthood
Becomes an Intuition, epistemic food.

So come, let us go once more into the breach,
Of the horizon that is forevermore out of reach;
This time, It would hold our becoming,
So we need not worry about crumbling.

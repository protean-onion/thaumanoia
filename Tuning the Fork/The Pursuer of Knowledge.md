# The Pursuer of Knowledge
Seeker: Why must I pursue knowledge?

Daimon: So that you may order your soul appropriately in light of the order of the world.

Seeker: Yes, but why must I undertake such a project, when I can kill myself right now and save myself the suffering necessary for such a project?

Daimon: Yes, you may, but note that in doing so you deprive yourself of the possibility of attaining to eudaimonia.

Seeker: What is eudaimonia?

Daimon: It means good-spiritedness, but that is only an etymological explanation of the word's meaning. Eudaimonia is a state in which, as mentioned earlier, the human soul is ordered to the world. In this state, a fuller set of possibilities is experienced as affordances, possibilities for action and dwelling. Consider this: you may be seeing suicide as a desirable possibility only because you, in your current state, are being deprived of what you still can be. Darkness is where the light is not. A few days ago, you were talking about how you are sick and burdened by ressentiment. How can you know what you are capable of in such a state? Is it not wise to perhaps consider, and even make efforts to attain, eudaimonia, as I have described it? It could even be the case that the thought of suicide completely vanishes from your mind.

Seeker: Okay. But I do not even know which direction to move toward. How could I possibly chance upon eudaimonia if I am too perplexed to even move?

Daimon: (Even the daimon freezes up)

(The seeker starts wondering to himself)
*   Maybe I'll chance upon eudaimonia, as I did for a few moments yesterday, and then I'll know which direction to move in.
*   Maybe I have killed my daimon.
*   You are ignorant. How could you know which direction to move in?
    *   There you go. You need to learn deeply about the world.

Daimon: Ah! After further consideration, I believe I have something. The bilateral mind is the mirror of nature, and it is self-teleological. This means that you must discover the intrinsic, and continue to do it till you discover a route to the extrinsic, such that those goals that feel imposed on you but necessary for survival are fulfilled, so that you may continue to engage more and more deeply with the intrinsic.
